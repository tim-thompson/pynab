Pynab Documentation
===================

Pynab is a simple Python wrapper for version 1 of the `YNAB API<https://api.youneedabudget.com>`.

This library very closely reflects the REST API provided by YNAB. A few minor changes have been made to make things easier to use.

Currently Pynab only supports authentication by access token. OAuth support is planned for the 1.0.0 release.
